# orazaka-web-client — Governance scope (agent-neutral)

> This repository is one component of the **Orazaka platform**. The normative contract is
> [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/krizaka/orazaka/blob/main/AGENTS.md) at the root of the Orazaka workspace
> ([`krizaka/orazaka`](https://github.com/krizaka/orazaka)), together with its `.agent/rules/*`. When this repository
> is cloned inside the workspace (`orazaka-apps/ui/orazaka-web-client`), that contract is loaded first and applies
> without exception. **No rule lives here** — this file only scopes it.

## Scope of this repository

- **Role:** Next.js (App Router) client of the Orazaka platform with its mandatory BFF.
- **Layer:** Client application
- **Depends on:** orazaka-ui-kit — never on another repository's Tier-3 implementation (AGENTS.md §2, [SEAM-002]).
- **Workspace path:** `orazaka-apps/ui/orazaka-web-client`

## Static rules & codemods (ast-grep)

The org code rules (addendum 2026-10-15) are lint rules, not review comments. [`@ast-grep/cli`](https://ast-grep.github.io)
is a **pinned devDependency** (no global install, CI reproduces local): `sgconfig.yml` + `rules/*.yml` (one rule per file,
with a message and, where safe, a `fix:`; written for Tsx and `.ts` is parsed as Tsx too, so each rule covers `.ts` and `.tsx`), `rule-tests/` (valid/invalid cases of each rule).

| Rule | What it refuses |
| :--- | :--- |
| `no-hand-ms-*`, `no-get-time-difference`, `no-get-time-arithmetic` | hand-written time arithmetic (`n * 60 * 1000`, `a.getTime() - b.getTime()`): date-fns, or a duration read from the settings |
| `no-env-in-domain` | an `env` import in domain code (`packages/*/src`, `src/`): the value arrives as a parameter |
| `no-db-in-service-or-rules` | a db client / schema import in `*.service.ts`, `*-service.ts`, `*.rules.ts`, `*-rules.ts` |
| `no-ts-enum` | the TypeScript `enum` keyword (`as const` object + derived type, or a Postgres enum) |
| `no-enum-string-compare` | `x.status === "OPEN"` (field named status/kind/role/reason/state/direction compared to a string literal) |
| `no-ambient-clock` | `new Date()` / `Date.now()` in domain code: the clock is injected |
| `no-types-at-package-root` | `types.ts` at a package root (`<feature>/<feature>.types.ts`) |
| `no-unjustified-numeric-export` | a numeric (or `…ToMilliseconds(n)`) `export const` in feature code without `// @fixed: <reason>` just above |
| `no-hand-made-nav`, `no-hand-made-language-switch` | a navigation bar that is not `NavBar` of @krizaka/ui (own Radix NavigationMenu, a local `NavBar`/`TopNav`), a hand-made language switch (`hrefLang` in a component, a row of `aria-pressed={locale === …}` buttons): use `NavBar` and `NavBar.Language` (« Navigation in the family », ui.krizaka.com) |

- **Run**: `npm run lint` runs everything (it includes `ast-grep test` and the ratchet). `npx ast-grep scan` lists the
  violations with their message; `npm run lint:sg:test` runs the rule tests.
- **Ratchet**: `scripts/sg-ratchet.mjs` counts the violations per rule and refuses any increase against
  `sg-ratchet.json` (same idea as `krizaka-ratchet` / `lint-ratchet.json`: the debt only goes down). Fixed some? Lock the gain with
  `npm run sg:ratchet:update` (it never raises a count and records a new rule at its current count). A new rule is
  added with its test in `rule-tests/` and its baseline in the same pull request. The script is identical in every
  Krizaka TypeScript repository (keep the copies identical; its unit test is `scripts/sg-ratchet.test.mjs`).
- **Codemods**: `npm run sg:fix` applies the `fix:` of the rules (`ast-grep scan --update-all`) and adds the date-fns import;
  behaviour is identical — run `npm run lint && npm test` after, and land the result in a small pull request.
- A rule is never silenced to get a PR green; fix the code, or (a business parameter that is a technical fact) justify it with `// @fixed:`.

## One app, three hosts (www.orazaka.com · dev.orazaka.com · admin.orazaka.com)

`www.orazaka.com` is the public site (production: indexed, canonical, sitemap, `llms.txt`). `dev.orazaka.com` answers its
pages with a 308 to www (only `/api/*`, `/.well-known/*`, `/robots.txt` and the health check stay) and is **never
indexed** — nor is any `dev.*` address, by its name, whatever the configuration (`isDevAddress`, `src/core/config/indexing.ts`).

The operator console (formerly the standalone `orazaka-web-admin` repository) lives here, served by **host routing**:
`src/proxy.ts` → `src/console/core/config/host.ts` (`routeFor`, pure) rewrites `Host: admin.*` under `/console`
(`src/app/console/**`, logic in `src/console/**`) and answers 404 for `/console/**` on every other host; the network gate
(`AUTH_ALLOWED_IPS`, 403) runs before any console route, sign-in included (`src/console/core/edge.ts`). The console never
shares the public site's session cookie, signing key (`AUTH_CONSOLE_SECRET`) or sign-in flag (`AUTH_CONSOLE_LOGIN_ENABLED`).
The public shell (`PublicShell`) skips itself for the `console` segment, so public pages stay static. Never add a console
route outside `src/app/console`, never link `/console/...` (addresses on the admin host are unprefixed), and keep
`/api/healthz` answered before any gate. Tests: `src/__tests__/host-routing.test.ts`, `npm run test:console`.

## Definition of done

1. `npm run validate` (or `lint` + `build`) is green inside the workspace (`orazaka-apps/ui`).
2. No hard-coded colors, 250-line cap per component, types only from `@krizaka/orazaka-shared` (AGENTS.md §8).
3. PR captures (screenshots, recordings, metrics) are never committed: they go to Bunny Storage under `pr-assets/<repo>/<pr-or-topic>/` with [`scripts/pr-assets.mjs`](https://github.com/krizaka/krizaka-com/blob/main/scripts/pr-assets.mjs) of krizaka-com (its AGENTS.md §5.1), and the PR body links their CDN URLs. `docs/screenshots/`, `.github/pr-assets/` and `.github/screenshots/` are git-ignored.
4. The change ships with its tests — a unit test for logic, a render test for a component, an end-to-end test for a
   route or a flow; a fix starts with a failing test that reproduces the bug. CI runs them and must be green; no test =
   not done (workspace [`AGENTS.md` §9](https://github.com/krizaka/orazaka/blob/main/AGENTS.md#9-testing)).

## Search engines & AI assistants (Krizaka family contract)

The contract is defined once, in krizaka-com `AGENTS.md` §2.4, and checked here by `scripts/check-seo-family.mjs` (a copy of
the same dependency-free file in every site's repository — keep the copies identical; its unit test sits beside it).

www.orazaka.com is **indexed**; `dev.*` and `admin.*` never are — robots `Disallow: /`, `X-Robots-Tag: noindex` on every answer, and
`noindex` in the pages when the deployment's own address (`APP_PUBLIC_URL`) is `dev.*` or `APP_SEARCH_INDEXING=off`
(`src/core/config/indexing.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`). What is indexed is described in `src/app/_seo/seo.ts`: origin, crawlers, JSON-LD, `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt` rendered from the synced docs; `src/app/robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `opengraph-image.tsx`). The language is chosen in the page (one URL per page), so there is no hreflang. The sign-in proxy (`src/proxy.ts`) must keep those files public. Tests: `src/__tests__/seo.test.ts`.

## Before you open or update a pull request (coding agents)

These are the defects code review found most often on 2026-10-23. Check them yourself before you open or update a pull request:
1. **Checks:** run the repository's full check (lint, typecheck, tests, build) and fix it. Never push a red check.
2. **Concurrency:** any « count then insert » or « check then write » runs in one transaction with a lock, and has a concurrency test.
3. **One gate:** a rule (limit, permission, validation) is enforced in the service, so no route can skip it. Test every route.
4. **Errors:** a cleanup (ROLLBACK, DROP, close) never masks the original error. Rethrow it, or throw an `AggregateError` with the original first.
5. **Validation:** validate the original input, never a truncated or pre-trimmed copy. Server and client reject the same inputs.
6. **Accessibility:**
   - every control has a unique label, and FR/EN pairs say their language;
   - focus rings are never clipped by `overflow`;
   - text never overflows its box at 360 px.
7. **Naming:** environment variables follow `<CONTEXT>_<THING>` (`APP_`, `DATABASE_`, `AUTH_`, `MEDIA_`, `MAIL_`, `PAYMENTS_`, `AI_`…) and are declared once.
8. **Words:** every user-facing string is in the FR and EN messages, and no colour is hard-coded.
9. **Review threads:** answer every one. Fix it test-first, or reply with the reason, then resolve it.

- **A bug means a missing guard** ([standard](https://github.com/krizaka/.github/blob/main/docs/standards/bug-means-missing-guard.md)): the fix PR first adds a guard that fails on `main`, then fixes the bug; the bug issue says why the guards missed it.

- **Default media** (avatars, banners, logos): their URLs come from the Krizaka org JSON (`@krizaka/org`: `listDefaults(kind)`, `defaultFor(kind, seed)`) — never hard-coded or bundled in this repository; a folder is never given a person. [Standard](https://github.com/krizaka/.github/blob/main/docs/standards/default-media.md).

**Repository layout:** the root follows [krizaka/.github `docs/standards/repo-layout.md`](https://github.com/krizaka/.github/blob/main/docs/standards/repo-layout.md); the CI guard `check-repo-layout` fails on a stray root file, and a justified extra is declared in `.repo-layout.json` with its why.

## 9. Anti-slop (ADR-015)

What a model tends to write and the code does not need. Each line points at the rule that refuses it
([ADR-015](https://github.com/krizaka/.github/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-015-ai-code-audit-measured-and-enforced.md), [docs/standards/guards.md](https://github.com/krizaka/.github/blob/main/docs/standards/guards.md)).

1. **No defensive null on `@NullMarked` code.** No `Objects.requireNonNull` or `if (x == null)` on a value the type already
   guarantees. Enforced by NullAway at compile time; a new package is `@NullMarked` (ArchUnit).
2. **A closed set is a type.** An enum, a sealed interface or an `as const` object, never a string compared by hand;
   strategies are a `Map<Kind, Strategy>` built once at startup. Enforced by PMD / ArchUnit (Java) and `no-enum-string-compare` (ast-grep).
3. **HTTP in Java is a DTO record, `@Valid` and `ProblemDetail`.** No `Map.of("error", …)`, no entity in a response, one
   `@RestControllerAdvice` per service. Enforced by ArchUnit.
4. **No `*Utils`, `*Helper` or `*Manager`.** Name the thing by what it does (§4). Enforced by ArchUnit (ADR-015 §5).
5. **`?.` and `??` in TypeScript**, not a chain of `&&` or a ternary on null. The target rules are `@typescript-eslint/prefer-optional-chain` and `prefer-nullish-coalescing`; they are not in `@krizaka/config` yet.
6. **The build is the judge.** Compile, lint and test before every push; `krizaka-edit-check` runs on each edit (below) and
   NullAway and ArchUnit run at pre-push and in CI. A rule is never silenced to get green.

**The edit hook.** Every repository adds this to `.claude/settings.json`. After each `Edit` or `Write`, the one file is
checked in under 10 s: ESLint with the repository's config for TypeScript, PMD with the Krizaka rules for Java (never Maven).
A finding comes back to the agent (exit 2); a timeout is silent.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "npx --yes -p @krizaka/config krizaka-edit-check", "timeout": 10 }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In a TypeScript repository that already depends on `@krizaka/config`, use `npx --no-install krizaka-edit-check` (no download).
