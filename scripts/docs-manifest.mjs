/**
 * The publication manifest of dev.orazaka.com/docs — what is published from the Orazaka repository
 * (https://github.com/krizaka/orazaka), where each page sits in the reader's journey, and the words that introduce it.
 *
 * The pages' CONTENT is never written here: `node scripts/sync-docs.mjs <orazaka checkout>` copies it from the source
 * markdown (hand-written under `docs/`, generated under `docs/_generated/` by `orazaka docs sync`). A fact that is wrong or
 * unclear is fixed in the Orazaka repository, then re-synced. What lives here is only the allow-list (a doc that is not
 * listed stays internal), the order, the curated title and one-line intro, and the sections a page leaves out.
 *
 * Journeys (the hub and the sidebar follow them): start → guides → reference. The reading path is the first two; the
 * reference (generated from the code) is folded. Only what a reader needs is published (Oussama, 2026-10-23: « réduis la doc au
 * plus essentiel »): the internal inventories — tools, automation protocol, jobs, the admin dump, the
 * screen-by-screen mobile notes — stay in the Orazaka repository. A page the manifest does not list stays on GitHub; its old address
 * answers 308 (`REMOVED_DOCS` in src/core/config/redirects.ts). `clip` names a recording of `src/core/clips/clips.ts`.
