 * The public bar of dev.orazaka.com as data — the product-site standard of every Krizaka product (addendum 2026-10-15,
 * docs/ux/information-architecture.md of the Orazaka workspace): the mark, then at most four entries grouped by the
 * visitor's question — **Product ▾** (what is it, what does it install, where do I get it?), **Docs** (how do I use
 * it?), then **Pricing** and **Open source** as direct links (#290). Simplified for epic #231: the gallery, the models page, the feature tours and the
 * platforms menu are gone (docs and the home hold what they said).
 * The bar, the mobile panel and the footer read this one list, in this order.
