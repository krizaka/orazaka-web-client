 * The signed-in user's balance, kept current from the SSE stream.
 *
 * Push rather than poll. A balance that only refreshes on navigation is a number
 * the user acts on after it stopped being true — and the whole reason the design
 * insists on showing cost before the click is that acting on a stale figure is
 * how an unexpected debit happens.
 *
 * The stream is the same one job progress rides; the server distinguishes the two
 * by event name. A dropped event costs a stale figure until the next one or the
 * next load, which is why the initial fetch still happens and nothing here
 * retries a lost message.
