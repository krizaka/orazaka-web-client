 * @description What the proxy knows of the site's addresses (krizaka/orazaka#443): the public ones, and the pages of the
 * signed-in app. A visitor without a session who asks for an address that is neither is not sent to the login page (that
 * answered 200 with the sign-in form for any typo): the page does not exist, and `src/app/not-found.tsx` says so with a 404.
 * `src/__tests__/app-routes.test.ts` checks that every route folder of `src/app` is listed in one of the two.
