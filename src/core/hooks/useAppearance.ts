 * @description The one appearance choice of the person — a mode or a named theme — on the organisation's mechanism
 * (@krizaka/ui/theme): dark by default, `html.light` for light, `html.theme-<name>` for a named theme.
 *
 * The profile stores a single value (`preferences.theme`): "system" | "light" | "dark" or a named theme. A named
 * theme sets every colour role, so its mode only decides `color-scheme`: solarized is light, the others dark.
 * `electric` is the 1.x blue identity, kept for the people who prefer it (the default is the Orazaka orange).
