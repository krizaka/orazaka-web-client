 * @description The steps of the Orazaka mobile app, in the order a person lives them: sign in, make an image, ask, follow the jobs. Each step is one recording of the real app (iOS simulator, signed in as the demo
 * persona (Mira), against dev.orazaka.com), in dark and in light, on the CDN under products/orazaka/mobile, already in a device frame, 9:16 (hashes:
 * core/media/media.generated.json); its words — goal, purpose, alt, the things to notice — are `t.mobile.steps`.
 * Typing is sped up and waits are cut, each cut labelled on the recording. A recording of anything but the app is not
 * shown: there is no mock-up, and no step without a recording.
