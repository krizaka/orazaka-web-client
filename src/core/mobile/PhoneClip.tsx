 * One recording of the real app in a phone: the clip already carries its device frame (9:16), played in place on demand. The app was
 * recorded in dark and in light; the one that matches the page is shown (`html.light` hides the dark one, the dark page hides the light one: `globals.css`, « Phone recordings »). Nothing loads before the visitor presses play
 * (`preload="none"`, the poster stands in) and nothing autoplays — which is also what reduced motion asks: the poster
 * alone until play is pressed. `alt` is the text alternative of the recording; the caption under it is optional (a step
 * explains itself beside the phone).
